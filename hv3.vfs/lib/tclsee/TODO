Issues with hv3see.c

hv3see.c:2048:

SEE_interpreter_init_hostglobal() does not exist. No idea if our
workaround is valid.

hv3see.c:2108:

When creating an interpreter we get an uncatchable exception.

When we uncoment the SEE_error_throw, we get a TCL exception, but also
an interpreter which seems to work.
